  <p>Located in  London&rsquo;s West End, the Landon Hotel is at the heart of the city. The West End  has something for everyoneâ€”from theater to dining to historic sights. And the  not-to-miss Rooftop Cafe is a great place for travelers and locals to engage  over drinks, food, and good conversation. Far from being solely a tourist  hotel, the West End Landon is an important venue for the local community and  meetings.</p>
